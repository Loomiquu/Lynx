<h2> What is Lynx UI and why should I use it? </h2>  

<h3> Lynx is a Declarative UI Framework, that includes an easy to use State Manager </h3>  

One reason you'd want to use Lynx, is due to it's unique UI creation system. Similar to Flutter's [Stateless Widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html) and [Stateful Widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html).  
Another reason is the easy to use local & global state manager.
